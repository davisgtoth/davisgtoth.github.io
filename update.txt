- want to make less terminal-y
- like the current theme (fonts, colours etc.) 
- like the "hook" of the cd animation when first loading the page, want to keep that
- but want to change to a larger website with multiple sub pages
	- instead of having projects all listed on main page, want to host details about them on individual pages
- so want to keep the hook with the cd animations, then scroll down to an updated projects section
	- want to keep an ls command to list all the projects on the website
	- want to have each project clickable, where you click one and it takes you to the separate page 
	- on the separate page is a write up about the project and includes all pictures/videos/links 
		- in terms of styling, like how the README.md's are styled on GitHub
		- was thinking of doing write up in markdown, rendering that in the html and styling with github markdown css
		- with the writeup/everything in the centre and not taking the whole width of the screen necessarily 
		- but also with potentially collages of pictures/rows and columns of pictures, which is not great in markdown
		- so if better, can also just write text in html? 
		- open to ideas but this is the vision 
		- probably want a centred title that is the title of the project, then the write up and images, then links and the end
	- ls and project listing is aligned to the left, on the right, is a carousel
		- carousel has image/gif of the selected project 
		- on default, cycles between each of the listing, staying on each for a set amount of time
		- if user hovers or a specific one, then jumps to that and shows that image/gif 
		- has carousel is cycling, the listing highlights/has an arrow pointing 
		- the carousel of images/gifs may also need a caption for maybe one-liners/tags of the project
- then want to flesh out the about section 
	- talk more about myself, my interests, my hobbies
	- include my cool pictures
	- imagining some sort of text paragraphs aligned to the left, the collages of pictures on the right 
	- pictures maybe at angles/overlapping to give it the collage feel
	- then text will be like the project individual pages, except aligned to left
		- so github markdown styling, maybe writing in markdown but don't know how going to work with picutres on the right
- other miscellaneous fixes: 
	- would be nice to have a fancy parallax scroll effect when entering the website
		- tried this before but messed with the relative links on the same page
	- also need to update the top bar with the proper links to the project pages
		- within the project pages, top bar would stay the same, but links would need to change?

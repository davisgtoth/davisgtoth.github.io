                <h2>The Competition</h2>
                <p>
                    For the annual Engineering Physics Robot Competition, in groups of four, we were tasked with
                    building a fully autonomous robot in just six weeks. Themed after Mario Kart, the challenge
                    required the robot to navigate a "Rainbow Road" circuit complete with shortcuts, competing
                    head-to-head against an opponent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective was to maximize our score within a strict time limit. Points were earned by
                    completing laps, retrieving item boxes, and collecting coins hung on a zipline, while avoiding
                    point-deducting "bombs". Beyond the course itself, the robot faced the added complexity of a dynamic
                    opponent, forcing it to actively avoid collisions while dodging "bananas" and additional bombs
                    dropped to sabotage the track.
                </p>

                <h2>System Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Meet R.O.B.erto, a custom-built autonomous racer designed to dominate the Rainbow Road. Capable of
                    precise tape following, active bomb avoidance, and item retrieval, the robot features a specialized
                    mechanism to autonomously mount and ride the zipline to gather the coins. R.O.B.erto was the only
                    robot in the entire 16-team competition to successfully complete this complex aerial challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the core of the system is an STM32 microcontroller acting as the mastermind, executing <a
                        href="https://github.com/josheuchert/ROBERTOBOT" target="_blank">C++ firmware</a> to control all
                    logic and behavior. The architecture utilizes an interrupt-driven design to handle real-time sensor
                    data from sonars and encoders. To drive the motors, we designed and soldered custom H-bridge PCBs
                    using discrete MOSFETs. Special attention was given to electrical routing to minimize
                    electromagnetic interference, ensuring that high-current motor noise never corrupted the delicate
                    signals from any of the sensors.

                <h2>Mechanical Design</h2>
                <p>
                    As mechanical lead, I designed a custom laser-cut <a

                        target="_blank">hardboard chassis</a> utilizing press-fit joinery to ensure structural rigidity
                    without the use of excessive fasteners. To withstand the rough journey around the course, I
                    integrated 3D-printed mounts that securely positioned the electronics and sensors. The chassis was
                    engineered to efficiently house the motors, batteries, and a cargo bay for collected items, all
                    while adhering to strict size constraints required to navigate the track. Crucially, the frame was
                    reinforced to support the robot's entire weight during the high-stress zipline descent. To complete
                    the race-ready look, the exterior was finished with custom "sponsorship" decals, giving R.O.B.erto a
                    distinct NASCAR-inspired aesthetic.

                <h2>Navigation & Control</h2>
                <p>
                    R.O.B.erto's navigation relied on a rear differential drive system balanced by a front caster wheel,
                    enabling tight cornering on the winding course. He tracked the path using a custom PCB housing an
                    array of six infrared reflectance sensors. Combining IR LEDs and phototransistors, these sensors
                    measured the intensity of reflected light, allowing the system to distinguish the absorbent black
                    tape from the reflective white surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When R.O.B.erto drifted off-center, the combined sensor readings quantified a positional error that
                    fed into a PID controller. This controller dynamically adjusted the left and right motor speeds to
                    keep him centered on the line. Additionally, a forward-mounted ultrasonic sensor actively scanned
                    for opponents, automatically reducing speed when obstacles were detected to prevent collisions.

                <h2>Item Box Collection</h2>
                <p>
                    To retrieve items and score points, R.O.B.erto utilized a custom intake mechanism dubbed the
                    "Elasti-Grab." This system consisted of a rotating wheel fitted with elastic bands that swept boxes
                    into an internal collection bay. Designed for robustness, the intake motor was monitored by a rotary
                    encoder coupled via custom 3D-printed gears. If the system detected a stall, it automatically
                    reversed the motor to clear the jam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid collecting point-deducting "bombs", the robot used a computer vision pipeline running
                    on a Raspberry Pi to identify the red hazards. To minimize architectural complexity, communication
                    between the Pi and the main STM32 microcontroller was streamlined to a single logic pin. When a bomb
                    was identified, this signal triggered the Elasti-Grab to spin in reverse, rejecting the object to
                    ensure only valid items were collected.

                <h2>Zipline</h2>
                <p>
                    The most technically demanding challenge of the race course was the zipline. To tackle this complex
                    problem, we engineered a custom scissor lift, driven by a lead screw and mounted to the rear
                    of the chassis. To simplify the latching process, the hook's geometry was designed to naturally
                    engage the pole as the robot drove towards it. At the top of the lift was a small tray embedded with
                    magnets, positioned to capture and retain the all the coins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure autonomous operation, a gyroscope was used to detect the incline of the course's ramp.
                    This signal initiated the lift, which was regulated by limit switches for precise positioning. After
                    reaching the end of the line, the robot executed a programmed dismount maneuver to unhook itself and
                    re-acquire the black tape to keep on racing.

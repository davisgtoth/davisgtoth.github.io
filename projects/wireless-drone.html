                <p>
                    The goal of the project is to design and build a drone that is wirelessly powered and
                    self-stabilizing. The drone is to be designed using strictly passive components, that is, the
                    drone itself contains no batteries, sensors or microcontrollers. The idea behind the project is that
                    magnetic fields that wirelessly transfer power to the drone can be manipulated into a well shape
                    which will provide a natural control mechanism to stabilize the drone.

                <h2>Theory</h2>
                <p>
                    The drone is powered through inductive coupling between a transmitting (TX) coil and multiple
                    receiving (RX) coil. From the Biot-Savart law, we know that a current-carrying wire generates a
                    magnetic field. If we drive the TX coil with a time-varying current, it will create a time-varying
                    magnetic field, and by Faraday's Law, this will induce a voltage in the RX coils on the drone. This
                    Induction, this time-varying magnetic field will induce a voltage in a nearby conductor. By placing
                    a
                    receiving coil on the drone within the magnetic field of the transmitting coil, we can induce a
                    voltage
                    in the receiving coil, which can then be rectified and used to power the drone's motors.
                    <br>

                    When the TX coil is driven with an AC signal, we know via the Biot-Savart law
                    that it creates a time-varying magnetic field. According to Faraday's Law, this time-varying
                    magnetic
                    field


                    The drone is powered using resonant inductive coupling, where power is transferred from a driving or
                    transmitting (TX) LC tank to four separate receiving (RX) LC tanks on the drone. The four RX coils
                    on the drone
                    give it a quadcopter design where each is hooked up via a full-wave rectifier to a motor that spins
                    a propeller. This quadcopter design allows the self-stabilizing mechanism to work as when the drone
                    drifts off center, the magnetic field strength in one of the coils increases, causing the motor in
                    one of the RX coils to spin faster, tipping and restoring the drone back into the well.

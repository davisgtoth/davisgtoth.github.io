                <p>
                    Ionic thrusters are a form of electric propulsion that generate thrust by accelerating ions using
                    electric fields. Compared to traditional chemical rockets, ionic thrusters are significantly more
                    efficient. However, they generate low levels of thrust and so are only used in outer space.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The goal of this project was to investigate the addition of AC technology to ion thrusters in the
                    hopes of increasing thrust and thrust efficiency for potential terrestrial applications. The project
                    was broken down into 4 stages, with simulation and design of both DC and AC thrusters.

                <p>
                    The project was approached from first principles, starting with the physics of ion propulsion.
                    The slides to the left outline the underlying mechanisms and theory that govern ionic thrusters in a
                    terrestrial setting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The slides also showcase possible AC modifications, including pulsing the DC voltage to generate
                    more ions while keeping the system efficient, as well as using a linear accelerating to boost the
                    thrust generated from the ions.

                <h2>Test Stand Design</h2>
                <p>
                    To derisk the development of the DC apparatus, a simulation was first developed. Linking together
                    the equations from the theory, a Jupyter Notebook was created to simulate the expected thrust and
                    efficiency of the DC thruster for various geometries and voltages.

                    <br>
                    Initial sketches were then created for the test stand. Because the ion thruster operates at high
                    voltages (up to 30kV), safety was a primary concern. The design was iterated on multiple times to
                    ensure that the high voltage components were properly insulated and shielded. Various sketches of
                    the test stand design and the safety circuitry are shown below.

                    Ultimately, the project was shelved due to cost and safety concerns surrounding the high voltages.
                    However, the project doesn't go without any loss. A lot was learned about how to scope out a
                    research project, think at a systems level, and work with high voltages.
